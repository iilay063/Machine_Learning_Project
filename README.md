# Machine Learning Project

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook used for supervised learning flow. If the notebook does not display correctly on your machine, try installing Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. You can also review the code-only version in `Assignment2_supervised_learning_flow.py`.

## Files
- `Assignment2_supervised_learning_flow.ipynb` – notebook with assignment skeleton.
- `Assignment2_supervised_learning_flow.py` – auto-generated Python script extracted from the notebook.
- `assignment2_ml_flow_instructions.pdf` – assignment instructions.
